        Over the past few days, Iâ€™ve been practicing my HTML and CSS by building
        small projects. Today, I decided to take on something simple but
        powerful, creating a form. At first, I thought forms were just about
        boxes to type into, but I quickly learned thereâ€™s more to it. Things
        like: -Structuring the form with divs for clarity -Structuring the form
        with divs for clarity -Adding placeholders to guide the user - Styling
        with borders, colors, and spacing to make it user-friendly - And most
        importantly, making sure the radio buttons work correctly (I got stuck
        here for a while ðŸ˜… but finally figured it out). Hereâ€™s a snippet from
        my form: it collects age and gender using radio buttons, then submits
        the data. Simple, but it gave me a good understanding of how real-world
        websites capture information. This small project reminded me that
        learning to code is not about rushing, but about celebrating every
        little win. Next, Iâ€™m excited to try adding more fields, styling the
        form responsively, and maybe connecting it to a database later on. Step
        by step, Iâ€™m growing as an emerging AI Developer. What was the first
        form you built when learning ? Many thanks to our amazing tutors
        Abdullahi Badrudeen Chris Ekwugum PublicaAI Dr. â€˜Bosun Tijani for making
        this possible.
